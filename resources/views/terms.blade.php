                <h1>VERO1 Terms of Service</h1>
                <p>Last Updated: February 6, 2018</p>
                <p>
                    These terms of service constitute a legally binding agreement (the “Agreement”)
                    between you and VERO1, Inc. (“VERO1,” “we,” “us” or “our”) governing your use of the
                    VERO1 application, website, and technology platform (collectively, the “VERO1
                    Platform”).
                </p>
                <p class="uppercase">
                    Please be advised: This Agreement contains provisions that govern how claims you
                    and VERO1 have against each other can be brought
                    (<a href="#tos-dispute-resolution-and-arbitration-agreement">see Section 17 below</a>).
                    These provisions will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you
                    have against VERO1 to binding and final arbitration on an individual basis, not as a
                    plaintiff or class member in any class, group or representative action or
                    proceeding. As a Driver or Driver applicant, you have an opportunity to opt out of
                    arbitration with respect to certain claims as provided in Section 17.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By entering into to this Agreement, and/or by using or accessing the VERO1 platform
                    you expressly acknowledge that you understand this Agreement (including the dispute
                    resolution and arbitration provisions in Section 17) and accept all of its terms.
                    <span class="uppercase">If you do not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions
                    of this Agreement, you may not use or access the VERO1 Platform.</span> If you use
                    the services of VERO1 or its affiliates in another country, by using the VERO1
                    Platform in that country you agree to be subject to VERO1’s terms of service for
                    that country.

                <h2>The VERO1 Platform</h2>
                <p>
                    The VERO1 Platform provides a marketplace where persons who seek transportation to
                    certain destinations (“Riders”) can be matched with persons driving to or through
                    those destinations (“Drivers”).  Drivers and Riders are collectively referred to
                    herein as “Users,” and each User shall create a User account that enables access to
                    the VERO1 Platform. Each person may only create one User account, and VERO1 reserves
                    the right to shut down any additional accounts. As a User, you authorize VERO1 to
                    match you with a Driver or Rider based on factors such as your location, the
                    estimated time to pickup, your destination, user preferences, and platform
                    efficiency, and to cancel an existing match and rematch based on the same
                    considerations. For purposes of this Agreement, the driving services provided by
                    Drivers to Riders that are matched through the Platform shall be referred to
                    collectively as the “Services”.   Any decision by a User to offer or accept
                    Services is a decision made in such User’s sole discretion. Each transportation
                    Service provided by a Driver to a Rider shall constitute a separate agreement
                    between such persons.

                <h2>Modification to the Agreement</h2>
                <p>
                    In the event VERO1 modifies the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such
                    modifications shall be binding on you only upon your acceptance of the modified
                    Agreement. VERO1 reserves the right to modify any information referenced in the
                    hyperlinks from this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall
                    become effective upon posting. Continued use of the VERO1 Platform or Services after
                    any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. Unless material
                    changes are made to the arbitration provisions herein, you agree that modification
                    of this Agreement does not create a renewed opportunity to opt out of arbitration
                    (if applicable).

                <p>
                    The VERO1 Platform may only be used by individuals who can form legally binding
                    contracts under applicable law. The VERO1 Platform is not available to children
                    (persons under the age of 18) or Users who have had their User account temporarily
                    or permanently deactivated. By becoming a User, you represent and warrant that you
                    are at least 18 years old and that you have the right, authority and capacity to
                    enter into and abide by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You may not
                    allow other persons to use your User account, and you agree that you are the sole
                    authorized user of your account.

                <h2>Charges</h2>
                <p>
                    As a Rider, you understand that request or use of the Services may result in
                    charges to you (“Charges”). Charges include Fares and other applicable fees, tolls,
                    surcharges, and taxes as set forth on your market’s VERO1 Cities page (<a href="https://www.VERO1com/cities">www.VERO1com/cities</a>), plus any tips to the
                    Driver that you elect to pay. VERO1 has the authority and reserves the right to
                    determine and modify pricing by posting applicable pricing terms to your market’s
                    VERO1 Cities page or quoting you a price for a specific ride at the time you make a
                    request. Pricing may vary based on the type of service you request (e.g., VERO1
                    Plus, VERO1 SUV) as described on your market’s VERO1 Cities page. You are responsible
                    for reviewing the applicable VERO1 Cities page or price quote within the VERO1 app
                    and shall be responsible for all Charges incurred under your User account
                    regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fares. There are two types of fares, variable and quoted.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Variable Fares</strong>. Variable fares consist of a base charge and
                        incremental charges based on the duration and distance of your ride. For
                        particularly short rides, minimum fares may apply. Please note that we use GPS
                        data from your Driver’s phone to calculate the distance traveled on your ride.
                        We cannot guarantee the availability or accuracy of GPS data. If we lose signal
                        we will calculate time and distance using available data from your ride.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Quoted Fares</strong>. In some cases VERO1 may quote you a Fare at the
                        time of your request. The quote is subject to change until the ride request is
                        confirmed. If during your ride you change your destination, make multiple
                        stops, or attempt to abuse the VERO1 Platform, we may cancel the fare quote and
                        charge you a variable fare based on the time and distance of your ride. VERO1
                        does not guarantee that the quoted fare price will be equal to a variable fare
                        for the same ride.

                    Fees and Other Charges.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Service Fee</strong>. You may be charged a “Service Fee” for each ride
                        as set forth on the applicable VERO1 Cities page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prime Time</strong>. At times of high demand for Services (“Prime
                        Time”) you acknowledge that Charges may increase substantially. For all rides
                        with a variable fare, we will use reasonable efforts to inform you of any Prime
                        Time multipliers in effect at the time of your request. For quoted fares we may
                        factor in the Prime Time multiplier into the quoted price of the ride.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cancellation Fee</strong>. After requesting a ride you may cancel it
                        through the app, but note that in certain cases a cancellation fee may apply.
                        You may also be charged if you fail to show up after requesting a ride. Please
                        check out our Help Center to learn more about

                    <li>
                        <strong>Damage Fee</strong>. If a Driver reports that you have materially
                        damaged the Driver's vehicle, you agree to pay a “Damage Fee” of up to $250
                        depending on the extent of the damage (as determined by VERO1 in its sole
                        discretion), towards vehicle repair or cleaning. VERO1 reserves the right (but
                        is not obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages prior
                        to processing the Damage Fee.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tolls</strong>. In some instances tolls (or return tolls) may apply to
                        your ride. Please see our Help Center and your market’s VERO1 Cities page for
                        more <a href="/helphc/articles/115012927787-Toll-info-for-passengers">
                        information about toll charges</a> and a list of applicable

                        and return charges</a>. We do not guarantee that the amount charged by VERO1
                        will match the toll charged to the Driver, if any.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Other Charges</strong>. Other fee and surcharges may apply to your
                        ride, including: actual or anticipated airport fees, state or local fees, event
                        fees as determined by VERO1 or its marketing partners, and processing fees for
                        split payments. In addition, where required by law VERO1 will collect applicable
                        taxes. See your market’s VERO1 Cities page for details on other
                        Charges that may apply to your ride.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Tips</strong>. Following a ride, you may elect to tip your Driver in
                        cash or through the VERO1 application. Any tips will be provided entirely to the
                        applicable Driver.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    General.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Facilitation of Charges</strong>. All Charges are facilitated through a
                        third-party payment processing service (e.g., Stripe, Inc., or Braintree, a
                        division of PayPal, Inc.). VERO1 may replace its third-party payment processing
                        services without notice to you. Charges shall only be made through the VERO1
                        Platform. With the exception of tips, cash payments are strictly prohibited.
                        Your payment of Charges to VERO1 satisfies your payment obligation for your use
                        of the VERO1 Platform and Services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>No Refunds</strong>. All Charges are non-refundable. This no-refund
                        policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate usage
                        of the VERO1 Platform, any disruption to the VERO1 Platform or Services, or any
                        other reason whatsoever.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Coupons</strong>. You may receive coupons that you can apply toward
                        payment of certain Charges upon completion of a Ride. Coupons are only valid
                        for use on the VERO1 Platform, and are not transferable or redeemable for cash
                        except as required by law.  Coupons cannot be combined, and if the cost of your
                        ride exceeds the applicable credit or discount value we will charge your
                        payment method on file for the outstanding cost of the Ride. For quoted or
                        variable fares, VERO1 may deduct the amount attributable to the Service Fee,
                        Tolls, or Other Charges before application of the coupon.  If you split payment
                        for a Ride with another User, your coupon will only apply to your portion of
                        the Charges.  Additional restrictions on coupons may apply as communicated to
                        you in a relevant promotion or by clicking on the relevant coupon within the
                        Promotions section of the VERO1 App.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Credit Card Authorization</strong>. Upon addition of a new payment
                        method or each ride request, VERO1 may seek authorization of your selected
                        payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the ride cost will be
                        covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a
                        charge, however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization
                        amount until your bank’s next processing cycle. Should the amount of our
                        authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be
                        subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or prepaid
                        card. We cannot be held responsible for these charges and are unable to assist
                        you in recovering them from your issuing bank. Check out our Help Center to

                    VERO1 does not provide transportation services, and VERO1 is not a transportation
                    carrier. VERO1 is not a common carrier or public carrier. It is up to the Driver to
                    decide whether or not to offer a ride to a Rider contacted through the VERO1
                    Platform, and it is up to the Rider to decide whether or not to accept a ride from
                    any Driver contacted through the VERO1 Platform. We cannot ensure that a Driver or
                    Rider will complete an arranged transportation service. We have no control over the
                    quality or safety of the transportation that occurs as a result of the Services.

                    the ability to provide or receive Services at any given location or time. To the

                    states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing

                    common sense when using the VERO1 Platform and Services, including looking at the
                    photos of the Driver or Rider you have matched with to make sure it is the same
                    individual you see in person. Please note that there are also risks of dealing with
                    underage persons or people acting under false pretense, and we do not accept

                    schedule transportation, goods, or other services with third party providers, but
                    you agree that VERO1 has no responsibility or liability to you related to any
                    transportation, goods or other services provided to you by third party providers
                    other than as expressly set forth in this agreement. Certain jurisdictions may not
                    allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. If these laws apply to you,
                    some or all of the above disclaimers, exclusions or limitations may not apply to
                    you, and you may have additional rights.

                    Agreement may be terminated: a) by User, without cause, upon seven (7) days’
                    prior written notice to VERO1; or b) by either Party immediately, without
                    notice, upon the other Party’s material breach of this Agreement, including but
                    not limited to any breach of Section 9 or breach of Section 10(a) through (i)
                    of this Agreement. In addition, VERO1 may terminate this Agreement or deactivate
                    your User account immediately in the event: (1) you no longer qualify to
                    provide Services or to operate the approved vehicle under applicable law, rule,
                    permit, ordinance or regulation; (2) you fall below VERO1’s star rating or
                    cancellation threshold; (3) VERO1 has the good faith belief that such action is
                    necessary to protect the safety of the VERO1 community or third parties,
                    provided that in the event of a deactivation pursuant to (1)-(3) above, you
                    will be given notice of the potential or actual deactivation and an opportunity
                    to attempt to cure the issue to VERO1’s reasonable satisfaction prior to VERO1
                    permanently terminating the Agreement. For all other breaches of this
                    Agreement, you will be provided notice and an opportunity to cure the breach.
                    If the breach is cured in a timely manner and to VERO1’s satisfaction, this
                    Agreement will not be permanently terminated. Sections 2, 6, 7 (with respect to
                    the license), 11-12, 14-19, and 21 shall survive any termination or expiration
                    of this Agreement.

                    This Arbitration Agreement is intended to require arbitration of every claim or

                    which by the terms of this Arbitration Agreement are expressly excluded from

                <p class="uppercase">
                    You understand and agree that you and VERO1 may each bring Claims in arbitration
                    against the other only in an individual capacity and not on a class, collective
                    action, or representative basis (“Class Action Waiver”).  You understand and
                    agree that you and VERO1 both are waiving the right to pursue or have a dispute
                    resolved as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective or
                    representative proceeding.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this subsection (b)
                    shall not apply to representative private attorneys general act claims brought
                    against VERO1, which are addressed separately in Section 17(c).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue
                    any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have
                    no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on a class,
                    collective, or representative basis. The arbitrator may award declaratory or
                    injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to
                    the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims.

                    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or

                    revocability or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil
                    court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which: (1)
                    the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) there
                    is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable as
                    to any Claims, then those Claims shall be severed from any remaining claims and may
                    be brought in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver
                    shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims to
                    the fullest extent possible.

                    (c) Representative PAGA Waiver.
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Arbitration
                    Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (1) you and VERO1 agree not
                    to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private
                    Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), California Labor Code § 2698 et seq.,
                    in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private
                    attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, both you and VERO1
                    agree that any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual
                    basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or
                    subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to
                    resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective
                    proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or
                    subject to any violations of law) (collectively, “representative PAGA Waiver”).
                    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration
                    Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability,
                    enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may
                    be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an
                    arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be
                    unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall
                    be severed from this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision
                    shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement
                    that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the
                    Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other
                    representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a
                    civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent
                    that there are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent
                    jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that
                    the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims,
                    the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the
                    outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.

                <p>
                    Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement shall be
                    administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its

                    Consumer Arbitration Rules</a> that are in effect at the time the arbitration
                    is initiated, as modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement. Copies of
                    these rules can be obtained at the AAA’s website (www.adr.org) (the “AAA
                    Rules”) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                    if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the
                    Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a
                    different set of AAA Rules, but in no event shall the arbitrator consolidate
                    more than one person’s Claims, or otherwise preside over any form of
                    representative, collective, or class proceeding.

                <p>
                    As part of the arbitration, both you and VERO1 will have the opportunity for
                    reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the
                    Claim. The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be
                    available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief
                    only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
                    necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claims. The
                    arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator’s
                    decision which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions
                    on which the decision is based.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with
                    applicable law, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The
                    arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving
                    different Riders or Drivers, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations
                    involving the same Rider or Driver to the extent required by applicable law.
                    The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award
                    rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
                    thereof, provided that any award may be challenged in a court of competent
                    jurisdiction.

                <p>
                    The payment of filing and arbitration fees will be governed by the relevant AAA

                        participating in the optional Negotiation process described in subsection
                        (k) below and are otherwise required to pay a filing fee under the relevant
                        AAA Rules, VERO1 agrees that, unless your claim is for $5,000 or more, your
                        share of the filing and arbitration fees is limited to $50, and that, after
                        you submit proof of payment of the filing fee to VERO1, VERO1 will promptly
                        reimburse you for all but $50 of the filing fee. If, however, the

                        sought in the claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as

                        guarantees owed by VERO1 to Drivers for Services, other than disputes relating

                        be collectively referred to as “Driver Claims”), VERO1 shall pay all costs
                        unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims
                        before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and
                        expenses (to the extent not paid by VERO1 pursuant to the fee provisions above).
                        However, if you are the party initiating the Driver Claim, you shall be
                        responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would
                        be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state
                        in which you provide Services to Riders, unless a lower fee amount would be
                        owed by you pursuant to the AAA Rules, applicable law, or subsection (e)(1)
                        above.  Any dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be
                        resolved by the arbitrator. For purposes of this Section 17(e)(3), the term
                        “Driver” shall be deemed to include both Drivers and Driver applicants who have
                        not been approved to drive.

                        that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would
                        incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court such as costs to subpoena
                        witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition

                        agrees that it will not seek such an award.

                        faith in the optional Negotiation process described in subsection (k)
                        below, then VERO1 will pay you the amount of the award or U.S. $1,000,
                        whichever is greater.

                </h5>

                <p>
                    Unless you and VERO1 agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings between VERO1 and
                    a Rider will take place in the county of your billing address, and any
                    arbitration hearings between VERO1 and a Driver will take place in the county in
                    which the Driver provides Services. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your
                    county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available
                    location for a AAA arbitration. If your Claim is for $10,000 or less, VERO1
                    agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on
                    the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic
                    hearing, or by an in-person hearing as determined by the AAA Rules. If your
                    Claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA
                    Rules.

                    This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of
                    claims: (1) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the
                    scope of such small claims court’s jurisdiction; (2) a representative action

                    unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law not
                    preempted by the FAA; (3) claims for workers’ compensation, state disability
                    insurance and unemployment insurance benefits; and (4) claims that may not be

                    to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any

                    remedies before making a claim in arbitration  However, should you bring an

                    from or relate to a claim previously adjudicated under this Arbitration Provision
                    or settled by you.  Similarly, you may not recover money damages under this
                    Arbitration Provision if you have already adjudicated such claim with the NLRB.
                    Nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration Agreement prevents your participation in

                    above) pursuant to the terms of this subsection if you have not previously agreed
                    to an arbitration provision in VERO1’s Terms of Service where you had the
                    opportunity to opt out of the requirement to arbitrate.  If you have previously
                    agreed to such an arbitration provision, you may opt out of any revisions to your

                    30-day period, you and VERO1 shall be bound by the terms of this Arbitration
                    Agreement in full (including with respect to Driver Claims that are not part of
                    a Pending Settlement Action). As provided in paragraph 17(i) above, any opt out

                    successful, could result in some monetary recovery to you. But if you do agree
                    to arbitration of Driver Claims with VERO1 under this Arbitration Agreement, you

                    collective, and/or representative action. You have the right to consult with
                    counsel of your choice concerning this Arbitration Agreement and you will not

                    Before initiating any arbitration or proceeding, you and VERO1 may agree to
                    first attempt to negotiate any dispute, claim or controversy between the
                    parties informally for 30 days, unless this time period is mutually extended by
                    you and VERO1. A party who intends to seek negotiation under this subsection
                    must first send to the other a written notice of the dispute (“Notice”). The
                    Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2)
                    set forth the specific relief sought. All offers, promises, conduct and
                    statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by
                    any of the parties, their agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential,
                    privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence of liability
                    or for impeachment, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties,
                    provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not
                    be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the
                    negotiation.

                    that you have complete discretion to provide Services or otherwise engage in

                    In addition to connecting Riders with Drivers, the VERO1 Platform may enable
                    Users to provide or receive goods or services from other third parties. For
                    example, Users may be able to use the VERO1 Platform to order a delivery of

                    your direction, or when travelling outside of the United States, to connect
                    with local transportation platforms and request rides from local drivers
                    (collectively, the “Other Services”). You understand and that the Other

                    At VERO1, we want to connect people through transportation and bring
                    communities together. In this privacy policy, we tell you what information
                    we receive from VERO1 riders and drivers, and how we use it to connect
                    riders with drivers and continue to improve our services. Below, we
                    explain how you can share with other riders and drivers in the VERO1
                    community as part of our mission to bring people together.

                    comprised of both VERO1 riders (“Riders”) and VERO1 drivers  (including
                    Driver applicants) (“Drivers”). Beyond the Privacy Policy, your use of

                    <p>
                        <strong>Registration Information</strong>. When you sign up for a VERO1
                        account, you give us your name, email address, and phone number. If
                        you decide to sign up for VERO1 using your Facebook account, we will
                        also get basic information from your Facebook profile like your name,
                        gender, profile photo, and Facebook friends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>User Profile Information</strong>. When you join the VERO1
                        community, you can create a VERO1 Profile to share fun facts about
                        yourself, and discover mutual friends and interests. Filling out a
                        profile is optional, and you can share as little or as much as you
                        want. Your name (and for Drivers, Profile photos) is always part of
                        your Profile. Read more below about how you can control who sees your
                        Profile. You can also add a Business Profile to your account, which
                        requires a designated business email address and payment method.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Payment Method</strong>. When you add a credit card or payment
                        method to your VERO1 account, a third party that handles payments for
                        us will receive your card information. To keep your financial data
                        secure, we do not store full credit card information on our servers.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Communications</strong>. If you contact us directly, we may
                        receive additional information about you. For example, when you
                        contact our Customer Support Team, we will receive your name, email
                        address, phone number, the contents of a message or attachments that
                        you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Driver Application Information</strong>. If you decide to join
                        our VERO1 driver community, in addition to the basic registration
                        information we ask you for your date of birth, physical address,
                        Social Security number, driver’s license information, vehicle
                        information, car insurance information, and in some jurisdictions we
                        may collect additional business license or permitting information. We
                        share this information with our partners who help us by running
                        background checks on Drivers to help protect the VERO1 community.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Payment Information</strong>. To make sure Drivers get paid,

                        information, and any other payment information provided by Drivers.

                    <h3>B.  Information We Collect When You Use the VERO1 Platform</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Location Information</strong>. VERO1 is all about connecting
                        Drivers and Riders. To do this, we need to know where you are. When
                        you open VERO1 on your mobile device, we receive your location. We may
                        also collect the precise location of your device when the app is
                        running in the foreground or background. If you label certain
                        locations, such as “home” and “work,” we receive that information,
                        too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your location information is necessary for things like matching Riders
                        with nearby Drivers, determining drop off and pick up locations, and
                        suggesting destinations based on previous trips. Also, if the need
                        ever arises, our Trust &amp; Safety team may use and share location
                        information to help protect the safety of VERO1 Users or a member of
                        the public. In addition to the reasons described above, Drivers’
                        location information and distance travelled is necessary for
                        calculating charges and insurance for VERO1 rides. If you give us
                        permission through your device settings or VERO1 app, we may collect
                        your location while the app is off to identify promotions or service
                        updates in your area.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Device Information</strong>. VERO1 receives information from
                        Users’ devices, including IP address, web browser type, mobile
                        operating system version, phone carrier and manufacturer, application
                        installations, device identifiers, mobile advertising identifiers,
                        push notification tokens, and, if you register with your Facebook
                        account, your Facebook identifier. We collect mobile sensor data from
                        Drivers’ devices (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration or
                        deceleration) to improve location accuracy and analyze usage patterns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Usage Information</strong>. To help us understand how you use
                        the VERO1 Platform and to help us improve it, we automatically receive
                        information about your interactions with the VERO1 Platform, like the
                        pages or other content you view, your actions within the VERO1 app, and
                        the dates and times of your visits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Call and Text Information</strong>. We work with a third party
                        partner to facilitate phone calls and text messages between Riders and
                        Drivers who have been connected for a ride. We receive information
                        about these communications including the date and time of the call or
                        SMS message, the parties’ phone numbers, and the content of any SMS
                        messages.  For security purposes, we may also monitor and/or record
                        the contents of phone calls made on the VERO1 Platform, such as those
                        between Riders and Drivers.  You will be given notice that your call
                        may be recorded, and by proceeding you agree to allow VERO1 to monitor
                        and/or record your call.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>User Feedback</strong>. At VERO1, we want to make sure Users
                        are always enjoying great rides. Riders and Drivers may rate and
                        review each other at the end of every ride. We receive information
                        about ratings and reviews and, as we explain below, give Riders
                        information about Drivers’ ratings and reviews and vice versa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Address Book Contacts</strong>. If you permit VERO1 to access
                        the address book on your device through the permission system used by
                        your mobile platform, we may access and store names and contact
                        information from your address book to facilitate invitations and
                        social interactions that you initiate through our Platform and for
                        other purposes described in this privacy policy or at the time of
                        consent or collection.

                        organization participates in one of our enterprise programs such as
                        VERO1 for Work, we may receive information about you, such as your
                        email address, from your participating organization. We also may give
                        your participating organization the opportunity to request a ride on
                        your behalf, in which case they may provide us with your name, phone
                        number, and the pickup and drop off location for your ride.

                        <strong>Background Information on Drivers</strong>. VERO1 works with
                        third party partners to perform driving record and criminal background
                        checks on Drivers, and we receive information from them such as
                        publicly available information about a Driver’s driving record or
                        criminal history.

                    <h3>A. Sharing Between Users</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Sharing between Riders and Drivers</strong>. Riders and Drivers that
                        have been matched for a ride are able to see basic information about
                        each other, such as names, photo, ratings, and any information they
                        have added to their Profiles. Riders and Drivers who connect their
                        VERO1 accounts to Facebook will also be able to see their mutual
                        Facebook friends during the ride. Drivers see the pick-up location
                        that the Rider has provided. Riders see a Driver’s vehicle information
                        and real-time location as the Driver approaches the pick-up location.
                        Riders’ ratings of Drivers are shared with Drivers on a weekly basis.
                        We de-identify the ratings and feedback, but we can’t rule out that a
                        driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or
                        feedback.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to
                        arrange a pickup, we do not share your actual phone number or other
                        contact information with other Users.  If you report a lost or found
                        item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or
                        Driver, including sharing actual contact information with your
                        permission.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Sharing between VERO1 Line Riders</strong>. If you use VERO1
                        Line, Riders who have been matched with you will be able to see your
                        name, photo and any information you have added to your Profile. If you
                        connect your VERO1 account to Facebook (such as by signing up through
                        Facebook), we may show your mutual friends with other Riders who are
                        also connected via Facebook.  During the VERO1 Line matching process we
                        may show photos of possible matches to you and other Riders.

                    <p>
                        <strong>API and Integration Partners</strong>.  If you connect to the
                        VERO1 Platform through an integration with a third party service, we
                        may share information about your use of the VERO1 Platform with that
                        third party.  We may share your information with our third party
                        partners in order to receive additional information about you.  We may
                        also share your information with third party partners to create offers
                        that may be of interest to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Third Party Services</strong>.  The VERO1 Platform may allow
                        you to connect with other websites, products, or services that we
                        don’t have control over (for example, we may give you the ability to
                        order a food delivery from a restaurant from within the VERO1 app). If
                        you use these services, we will provide the third party with
                        information about you to allow them to provide the service to you (for
                        example, we would give the restaurant your name, phone number and
                        address to drop off the food).  We can’t speak to the privacy
                        practices of these third parties, and we encourage you to read their
                        privacy policies before deciding whether to use their services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Service Providers</strong>.  We work with third party service
                        providers to perform services on our behalf, and we may share your
                        information with such service providers to help us provide the VERO1
                        Platform, including all of the things described in Section 3 above.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Enterprise Partners</strong>.  If you participate in an
                        enterprise program and charge a ride to your organization’s billing
                        method or credits, we will provide your organization’s account holder
                        with information about your use of the VERO1 Platform, including ride
                        details such as date, time, charge, and pick up and drop off
                        locations. If you create a Business Profile, at the end of each ride
                        you will have the option to designate the ride as a business ride. If
                        you do so, and your organization has a corporate account with VERO1, we
                        may share information about your use of VERO1 Platform with your
                        organization including ride details such as date, time, charge, and
                        region of the trip. If you change organizations, it is your
                        responsibility to update your Business Profile with the new
                        information.  (Please remember to check and set your designation
                        settings accordingly.) If you integrate your account with an expense
                        platform (like Concur) we will share the ride details to your expense
                        account.

                    <p>
                        <strong>International Partners</strong>.  We’ve partnered with several
                        ride-sharing services around the globe so Riders can continue to find
                        rides when they open the VERO1 app abroad, and Drivers can provide
                        services to international travelers in the U.S.  When we match a ride
                        with the partner, we share the same information that is shared between
                        matched Riders and Drivers on the VERO1 Platform. In some cases we are
                        unable to mask your phone number if you call an international driver,
                        so please keep that in mind before using this feature.

                        <strong>Other Sharing</strong>.  We may share your information with

                    <strong>Email Subscriptions</strong>. You can always unsubscribe from our
                    commercial or promotional emails but we will still send you transactional
                    and relational emails about your account use of the VERO1 Platform.

                <p>
                    <strong>Text Messages</strong>. You can opt out of receiving commercial or
                    promotional text messages by texting the word END to 46080 from the mobile
                    device receiving the messages.  You may also opt out of receiving all
                    texts from VERO1 (including transactional or relational messages) by
                    texting the word STOPALL to 46080 from the mobile device receiving the
                    messages, however, opting out of receiving all texts may impact your use
                    of the VERO1 Platform.  Drivers can also opt out of driver-specific
                    messages by texting STOP in response to a driver SMS.  To re-enable texts
                    you can text START in response to an unsubscribe confirmation SMS.

                <p>
                    <strong>Push Notifications</strong>.  You can opt out of receiving push
                    notifications through your device settings.  Please note that opting out
                    of receiving push notifications may impact your use of the VERO1 Platform
                    (such as receiving a notification that your ride has arrived).

                <p>
                    <strong>Profile Information</strong>. While your name will always be

                    additional information that you added to your Profile at any time if you
                    don’t want Drivers and VERO1 Line Riders to see it. Riders will always be
                    able to see Drivers’ names, rating, profile photos, and vehicle

                    from sharing location information at any time through your Device’s
