                            Sometimes stores runout of stock of an item and only substitute items are available.  However, if an item you need is not exactly what you ordered, your driver will work with you to try and get it or return it for you.  You can reach your driver by phone or text.  If a store is out of an item and you have not specified any alternatives instructions with your order, your driver will usually contact you by phone to ask whether you want him to get a substitute or not and if so, which ones based on whether it is also in stock at the store.

                           Prices at retail stores and especially at groceries, supermarkets, and pharmacies fluctuate a lot and often daily or weekly.

Thus, the total purchase price may be different (higher or lower) due to taxes, price changes by the retailer, promotions, and coupons.
